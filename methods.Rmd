## Pre-Processing

- factorized variabes
- removed patient id and died
- removed 0 valued point for Gamma model
- imputed the missing values with the mean
- split into train/test sets


## Feature selection
- Interaction + no interaction
- Stepwise selection w/ AIC criterion
- Determined whether to keep NA imputation
- ANOVA to determine better model

## Diagnostics
- Deviance residuals + Cook's distances
- For GLM, residual deviance over df
- VIF

## GAM
- Smoothed age and sex
- Centered higher order terms
- Visualized new deviance residuals
